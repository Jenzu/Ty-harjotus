Need for Speed

Need for Speed, also known by its initials NFS, is a series of
racing video games published by Electronic Arts (EA)
Almost all of the games in the NFS series employ the same fundamental rules and similar mechanics:
the player controls a race car in a variety of races, the goal being to win the race.
The concept of car tuning evolved with each new game, from focusing mainly
on the mechanics of the car to including how the car looks.
Each game has car tuning which can set options for items like
ABS, traction control), or downforce, or for upgrading parts like the engine or gearbox.
Visual tuning of the player's car becomes important in tournament/career mode
after the releaseof Need for Speed: Underground 2,
when the appearance is rated from zero to ten points.
