Crysis

Crysis is a first-person shooter video game developed by Crytek and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows.
The player controls a Delta Force soldier codenamed Nomad.
The player's weapons can be customized without pausing the flow of time,
for example changing firing modes, changing scopes or adding sound suppressors.

The player is also capable of selecting various modes in Nomad's military
"Nanosuit" which draw power from the suit's energy.
When the suit's energy is depleted, no modes can be used and the player is more vulnerable to damage before the suit recharges.

One of four modes can be selected:
Armor deflects damage and recharges the suit's energy faster.
Strength allows stronger hand-to-hand combat, the bility to throw objects
and enemies with deadly force, higher jumps, steadier aiming and reduced weapon recoil.
Speed increases running and swimming speed, as well as other forms of motion
such as reloading weapons.
And Cloak, which renders Nomad almost completely invisible and
suppresses movement noise.
